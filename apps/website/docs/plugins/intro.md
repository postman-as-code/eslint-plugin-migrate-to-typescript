# What ESLint plugins are?

`eslint` plugins are third-party extensions for eslint.

Before using the plugin, you have to install it.

Because our docs focus on opinionated conventions, for more general understanding here are some references/docs you can read:

1. The official `eslint` document ["Configuring Plugins"](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/plugins).
2. A great explanation about the difference between an eslint `plugin` and an eslint `config` from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54522973/11554280).

## Our Plugins
