# what are eslint plugins?

`eslint` plugins provide third-party to extend eslint.
Before using the plugin, you have to install it.

Because this website focuses on opinionated conventions, here some references for more general understanding you can read these docs:

1. the official `eslint` document ["Configuring Plugins"](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/plugins).
2. A great explanation about the difference between an eslint `plugin` and an eslint `config` from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54522973/11554280).
