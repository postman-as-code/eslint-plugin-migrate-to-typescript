# what are eslint plugins?

`eslint` supports the use of third-party plugins. Before using the plugin, you have to install it using npm.

Because this website is about focusing on opinionated conventions, here is the best summary/intro to plugin you can have:

1. the official `eslint` document ["Configuring Plugins"](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/plugins)
2. great explanation about the difference between an eslint `plugin` and an eslint `config` from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54522973/11554280)

## our plugin list

### eslint-plugin-migrate-to-typescript
